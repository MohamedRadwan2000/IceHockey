# IceHockey(Camera recognisation problem)
l from the IIHF (International Ice Hockey Federation) requesting a system to raise an alarm to the referee when there are too
many players from the same team inside the rink. The system will be composed of three parts:
• A digital camera in the ceiling to take photos of the rink every second.
• A software module to extract the position of each player from the photo taken by the
digital camera.
• A software module to count the number of players from the same team inside the hockey
rink.
